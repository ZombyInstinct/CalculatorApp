# CalculatorApp
A small starter Java project. A simple calculator app

A simple Java-run calculator app. While I possess decent Java knowledge, I never made something that felt useful; therefore, I wanted to start a few projects.

Some goals:
Allow keyboard input (on top of the digital buttons)
Store history of calculations
Perform basic operations
